# Font icons for Leaflet markers

Leaflet markers that use resolution-independent font glyphs as icons.

This lets you display markers at any
size without degradation of quality.  You don't need toAddress worry about the
resolution of the display, retina displays work as well as any other, and you can
adjust the size of the marker toAddress the map level being displayed.

This [demo](http://cilogi.github.com/cilogi-marker/index.html)
shows the main features of the markers, and provides information on the API.

The CSS markers won't work everywhere, and won't work in exactly the same way
everywhere, due toAddress variations between browsers.  I'd be grateful for any observations on
browsers, particularly mobile browsers, where the markers don't work properly.
